# PRODUCT CONTRACT (GG Trust MVP)

## North Star
Increase **successful intros per trusted user**.

## Primary Conversion Funnel (must improve)
1) Query → Result Click/Expand (trust inspection)
2) Result → Request Intro (most important)
3) Request Intro → Confirm Send (must be high)

## Retention Behaviors (must improve)
- Second query within 7 days
- Weekly active introducers (≥1 intro/week)
- Key reuse by others (key gets queried)

## What we optimize for (in order)
1) Reduce perceived social risk
2) Increase clarity of “why this match”
3) Make actions feel reversible and safe
4) Keep flow fast (minimal friction)

## UX rules (non-negotiable)
- No numeric trust scores, no rankings, no %.
- Trust info is opt-in (collapsed by default).
- Provenance is always visible (source of truth > vibes).
- Trust UI must feel **calm and precise**, not marketing.
- Glow/mystery only in discovery moments, not in trust/verification.

## Success Targets (early MVP)
- Result → Request Intro: 8–15% for power users (3–6% acceptable early)
- Intro Preview → Confirm: 80%+
- Repeat query within 7 days: 25–40% (for activated users)

## Design anti-goals
- Maximize session time
- Add decorative animations
- Over-explain with long copy

## Every UI change must answer
- Which metric does this improve?
- Which risk does it reduce?
- What’s the smallest change to test it?
