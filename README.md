# GG Product Memory

This folder is a living, IDE-native record of my understanding of GG’s product vision, core mechanics, and design hypotheses.

It is intentionally raw, evolving, and optimized for:
- Fast iteration
- Deep product thinking
- AI-assisted reasoning in Cursor
- Translating insight → prototype → shipped product

This is not a polished PRD. It is product memory.

## How to use this folder

- Dump raw thoughts first into `00_context.md`
- Refine ideas into focused docs as clarity emerges
- Update freely; version history matters
- Use Cursor to summarize, refactor, and reason across files

If something feels unclear, it belongs here.
